House and Flat Price Prediction üè†üí∞
Project Description
This project aims to predict the prices of houses and flats based on user inputs and a trained machine learning model. The system allows users to:

Analyze house/flat price trends.
Predict the price of a property based on various features.
Provide recommendations and insights on properties.
The project includes:

Web Scraping: Data collected from real estate websites.
Data Processing: Cleaned and prepared for analysis and modeling.
Price Prediction: Based on user inputs via a Streamlit web app.
Recommendations: Insights and analysis to guide property buyers.
Features of the Application
User Input:
Property type (flat or house).
Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, balconies, etc.
Property age, furnishing type, luxury category, etc.
Prediction:
Predicts the price range for a property based on user inputs.
Recommendations:
Provides analysis and insights to help users make informed decisions.
Web Interface:
A user-friendly Streamlit application.
Tools and Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Modeling: Scikit-learn
Web App: Streamlit
Data Source: Web scraping from real estate platforms
Model Deployment: Pickle for saving pipeline and models

Key Features of the Prediction Model
Uses a robust machine learning pipeline to predict prices.
Outputs price range (low and high estimates) for user-specified properties.
Future Scope
Enhance the web scraping pipeline to include more data sources.
Incorporate additional features like location-based analysis.
Deploy the model as a cloud-based API for broader accessibility.
Add advanced data visualizations for better user insights.
Example Usage
Select property type, sector, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.
Input built-up area and other optional details.
Click Predict to get the estimated price range.
